## Welcome to LLMonade

LLMonade is an open-source AI evaluation tool that helps small development teams systematically improve their LLM-integrated applications through guided, manual error analysis. The streamlined interface pulls real trace data, allows for quick annotation of outputs, automatically categorizes failure patterns, and identifies the highest ROI fixes. LLMonade’s step-by-step approach empowers teams new to AI evaluation to adopt the proven best practice of manual error analysis.

## 🍋 What is LLMonade?
LLMonade is an evaluation tool that provdes:
- a guided error analysis workflow
- a frictionless annotation interface
- automated trace ingestion with an existing observability tool
- automated deployment to AWS

## 🍃 Key Features
- **Root Spans Extract, Transform, Load Pipeline:** LLMonade integrates seamlessly with the AI observability tool Phoenix.
- **Automated ETL:** Once deployed, the ETL pipeline automatically ingests existing traces from Phoenix and any new traces that get generated.
- **Effective Human Review Interface:** Purpose-built interface that removes all friction from data inspection: keyboard shortcuts keep the review process moving quickly, llm-structured input/output allows for an easy-on-the-eye data viewing experience, unified data viewer displays all information needed to evaluate an output without needed to switch between windows.
